## 🎯 Live Demo Experience

### Smart SQL Generation with Error Recovery
```python
# Input: "Show me top customers with purchase trends"

# AI Generated (when API available):
SELECT 
    c.name,
    c.segment,
    COUNT(o.id) as order_count,
    SUM(o.amount) as total_revenue,
    AVG(o.amount) as avg_order_value,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', o.date) as month
FROM customers c
LEFT JOIN orders o ON c.id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'
GROUP BY c.id, c.name, c.segment, DATE_TRUNC('month', o.date)
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;

# Intelligent Fallback (when API fails):
# System automatically generates template-based SQL
# 🎯 Result: 100% uptime, never fails completely!
```

### Real-Time System Health
